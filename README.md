# data_structures

One of my favorite ways to learn a language is to code a data structure.
Data structures usually require a good knowledge of memory management,
so it feels like the perfect way to explore a new language.

Currently, I have developed the following data structures:

- Array (C++)
- Dynamic Array/Vector (C++)
- Doubly Linked List with tail (C++)
- Singly Linked List (MIPS)
- Binary Search Tree (C++)
- AVL Tree (C++)

### Future

In the future, I expect to add some data structures in Rust and also some graphs in C++.
